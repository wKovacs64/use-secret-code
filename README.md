## Installation

```
npm install use-secret-code
```

## What is this?

This is a custom [React][react] [hook][hooks-intro] for adding "cheat codes" to
your app. It will listen for a given sequence of keystrokes and track whether
the corresponding "cheat" is enabled or disabled. You can then react (üòè)
accordingly (e.g. toggle a feature, pop an alert or notification, etc.). Just
having a little fun here with this throwback to [how we used to enter cheat
codes in video games][konami-code-video].

## Package Name

This package was originally called `use-cheat-code` but apparently the word
"cheat" is against [npm policies][npm-policies], so they denied my attempt to
publish the package under that name and I was forced to pick a new name. I went
with `use-secret-code` (it's not great, but what else do you call a cheat
code?), but I still export `useCheatCode` as well as `useSecretCode`. They are
the same thing, but I will personally be importing `useCheatCode` in my own
projects.

## Usage

```js
// import { useSecretCode } from 'use-secret-code'; // alternate
import { useCheatCode } from 'use-secret-code';

function CheatCodeExample() {
  const invulnerability = useCheatCode(['i', 'd', 'd', 'q', 'd']);
  return (
    <span>Invulnerability: {invulnerability ? 'enabled' : 'disabled'}</span>
  );
}
```

## Browser Support

This should work in all modern browsers, but you'll need to polyfill `Set` for
use in IE11. See the playground project in the [`example`][example] directory
for one approach.
